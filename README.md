# AI-Powered LaTeX Diagram Generator for Academic Research

This project enables users to generate complex LaTeX diagrams, such as flowcharts, ER diagrams, and system architectures, by simply providing natural language instructions. The system uses foundation models hosted on IBM watsonx.ai to convert textual prompts into LaTeX (TikZ) code with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

- Converts plain English diagram descriptions into LaTeX TikZ code.
- Utilizes agentic AI to understand instructions and generate precise diagram structures.
- Supports academic use cases by automating technical diagram creation.
- Deployed and executed using IBM Cloud services.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **IBM watsonx.ai** – for model deployment and execution
- **Granite-3B/8B-Instruct Model** – for natural language to LaTeX code generation
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage** – for storing generated files and outputs
- **IBM Code Engine / Cloud Foundry** – for running the backend services
- **IBM API Gateway** – for managing secure and scalable API endpoints

## Result

The system significantly reduces manual effort in creating academic diagrams, enabling researchers to focus more on content than formatting, while maintaining LaTeX-level quality and consistency.
